Title: Strategy
Description: Vision of the AfricaMuseum
---
As a museum and research centre, the **AfricaMuseum** is a forum for study and dialogue on societies and the natural environment in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The AfricaMuseum is a place of memory and tells the history of the colonial past but also works with and on the Africa of today and tomorrow.
The AfricaMuseum is committed to generating interest and promoting social involvement in the challenges of today and tomorrow.
The AfricaMuseum does not walk that path alone, instead building sustainable partnerships, in Belgium, in Europe and especially in Africa.

Mission of the AfricaMuseum
The vision of the AfricaMuseum is realised through attentive management of the collections in our care. Through our research, our collaborations and partnerships and with the organisation of exhibitions, events and education we widely share these collections and the knowledge and values they bring.
In its relationships with the public, and with youth and the African diaspora in particular, the AfricaMuseum aims to be accessible and inclusive.
As a forum for study, education and dialogue, the AfricaMuseum adopts a participatory approach, striving for co-creation.
